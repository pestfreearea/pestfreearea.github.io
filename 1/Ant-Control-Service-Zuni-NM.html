<p>Also, think about how the range of plants to be grown in the exact same area might affect ease of pesticide applications and spread of illness. Pest control pertains to non-lethal techniques too, such as keeping the area tidy and complimentary of any food debris or other attractants, sealing up entry methods such as cracks in walls or the space between the bottom of a door and the flooring.</p>
