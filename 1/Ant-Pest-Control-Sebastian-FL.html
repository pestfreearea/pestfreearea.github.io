<p>For some tasks, pest control workers use a mix of pest management techniques, a practice known as incorporated pest management. The cornerstone of an effective IPM program is a schedule of regular inspections. Crop losses due to arthropods, weeds, and illness, though challenged by some as a valid step, have increased on a world basis from 34.9% in 1965 (3) to 42.1% in 1988-1990 (4) in spite of the intensification of pest control.</p>
<p>Our Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach is based on our 4 concepts that together we call ERDM. We comprehend that discovering pests in your home or business is upsetting. Versatility and Time- The process of pest control takes some time and efforts. Pests are undesirable plants, animals, insects, bacteria or other organisms that disrupt human activity.</p>
<p>Lots of newer pesticides are originated from plants or naturally occurring compounds (e.g.-- nicotine, pyrethrum and bug juvenile hormonal agent analogues), however the toxophore or active element might be altered to provide increased biological activity or stability. Most scientists agree that this will be possible just if we cultivate crops according to the concept of Integrated Pest Management (IPM).</p>
<p>Identification of the pest, understanding its biology and seasonal population patterns, harmful life stages and their environments, nature of the damage and its economic significance, the vulnerability of each life phase for several control choices, host preference and alternate hosts, predictability of pest event based on the environment, cropping patterns, farming practices, and other influencing aspects, and all the related details is crucial for identifying an efficient control strategy.</p>
