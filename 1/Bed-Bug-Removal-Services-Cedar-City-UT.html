<p>Pesticide risks include severe, instant toxicity to people and other non-target organisms; long-term or chronic toxicity such as cancer; and environmental contamination of the air, or ground and surface area water.

<p>Pests managed: Use horticultural oils to combat aphids, termites, beetles, leaf miners, caterpillars, thrips, leafhoppers, and whiteflies. Under EPM, chemicals need to be utilized just as a last option, after mechanical, cultural, and biological techniques have been attempted and revealed ineffective.
