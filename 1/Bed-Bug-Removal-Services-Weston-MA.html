<p>Examples of cultural practices that encourage natural enemies and dissuade pest determination include intercropping (several crops in the exact same field) to make it harder for pests to discover a host plant, planting trap crops which attract pests far from harvest crops and which can later be treated with select application of pesticides, and delaying planting times to accompany times where pests have emerged and died off for the season.</p>
<p>Utilizing natural enemies as an alleviative control is less successful compared to using them preventively. Employ suitable searching methods and treatment decisions to maintain the helpful insects that can provide extra bug pest control. Carefully monitor fields for all pests to figure out the requirement for restorative insecticide treatments. Now long term efficient pest control is available on your fingertips.</p>
<p>Think about alternative approaches (besides pesticides) to make your house and garden unappealing to pests. With IPM, you act to keep pests from becoming a problem, such as by growing a healthy crop that can stand up to pest attacks, using disease-resistant plants, or caulking cracks to keep insects or rodents from getting in a structure. Current missions for reliable, safe, and long lasting pest management programs have been targeted mainly towards advancement of new and much better products with which to change conventional hazardous pesticides.</p>
