Removal methods consist of use of animal traps, sticky cards for insects, manual removal of insects from plants (e.g., hand selecting or spraying with a hose pipe), getting rid of contaminated or diseased products (e.g., pruning branches or eliminating unhealthy litter).</p>
<p>Although botanical extracts such as azadirachtin and pyrethrins, and microbe-derived harmful metabolites such as avermectin and spinosad are regarded as biologicals (Lasota and Dybas 1991, Sarfraz et al. 2005, Dodia et al. 2010 ), they are still chemical particles, similar to artificial chemicals, and have many of the ecological and human security dangers as chemical pesticides.</p>
<p>The success of control techniques must be measured using indications based on monitoring of harmful organisms, beneficials, pesticide use, and effect on the environment.
