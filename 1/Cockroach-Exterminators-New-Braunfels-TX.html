<p>Destruction of crop residue: Pupae of pest remains inside the crop residue and can be controlled by damaging it. IPM is practiced to some degree in all farming crops, but synthetic pesticides stay a dominant technique in managing pests. Perhaps you're the type to dive in, research study your pest, explore the most efficient control alternatives, and are feeling well prepared to take things on on your own.</p>
<p>Pest Management truth sheets Information on arthropod pest abundance, location within the greenhouse, and population patterns (increases, decreases, or steady) help determine the efficiency of pest management techniques.

<p>Biological control has actually been effectively used in greenhouses (van Lenteren 1988) and specialty crops such as strawberries grown in the field (Zalom et al. 2018 ).
