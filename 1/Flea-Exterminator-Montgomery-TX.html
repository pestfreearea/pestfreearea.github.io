<p>The very first line of defense in IPM is to avoid and suppress insect pest population through nonchemical techniques such as cultural practices, usage of resistant varieties, proper irrigation and fertilization, and natural opponents. IPM thinks about the environment as an entire and thinks about a well balanced mix of the abovementioned control methods to produce the most efficient and least harmful plan.</p>
<p>Knowing what your plants require-- and providing all they need-- gives you the edge over pests. As the mentioned objective of an IPM system is to remove or at least attenuate the economic effect of pests, efficacy in the reduction of pest populations is a primary indication of efficiency of the system. Orion Pest Control offers the most effective, reliable and safe home pest control services for homeowners and builders in USA at economical rates.</p>
<p>If pesticides are required, they are chosen and used in a way that prevents interrupting other IPM practices.

<p>Plants proven to withstand your area's most common pests hold up much better under attack.
