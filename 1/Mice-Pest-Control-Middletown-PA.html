<p>Numerous more recent pesticides are derived from plants or naturally occurring substances (e.g.-- bug, pyrethrum and nicotine juvenile hormone analogues), but the toxophore or active element might be altered to offer increased biological activity or stability.

<p>Tighter guidelines for food safety, occupational health and safety, and the environment mean in-house pest control isn't an alternative for many food organisations these days. Farmers are confronted with myriad of production challenges where the most common problems are pests, that include weeds, diseases, and insects.
