<p>As part of the Sustainable Use Instruction on Pesticides, expert users of pesticides are required to consider the concepts of IPM prior to using chemicals. Biological pest control is an approach of managing pests such as insects and mites by using other organisms 8 It depends on predation, parasitism, herbivory or other natural mechanisms, but normally also involves an active human management role.</p>
<p>The success of control methods need to be measured using indicators based upon monitoring of harmful organisms, beneficials, pesticide use, and effect on the environment. These include the resurgence of pest populations after decimation of the natural enemies, advancement of insecticide-resistant populations, and unfavorable influence on nontarget organisms within and outside the crop system.</p>

Evaluation is frequently among the most essential steps in Integrated Pest Management (Bennett et al., 2005 ). It is the process of evaluating an IPM program and the results it has actually produced.</p>
