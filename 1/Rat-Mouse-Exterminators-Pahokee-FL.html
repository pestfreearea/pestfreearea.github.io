<p>We traditionally have actually sold nature short, both in its ability to reduce the effects of the efficiency of ecologically unsound techniques along with its selection of inherent strengths that can be used to keep pest organisms within bounds. For instance, strains of predaceous mites, rove beetles, lacewings, and types of parasitoids have been picked for increased levels of resistance to insecticides, consequently increasing the probability that some will endure insecticide treatments directed at pests.</p>
<p>The Georgia Pest Management Handbook provides current information on selection, application, and safe usage of pest control chemicals. New clients conserve 10% off preliminary pest control services or save $50 off termite treatments.
