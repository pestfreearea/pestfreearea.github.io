For instance, strains of predaceous mites, rove beetles, lacewings, and types of parasitoids have been picked for increased levels of resistance to insecticides, consequently increasing the probability that some will endure insecticide treatments directed at pests.</p>
<p>The Georgia Pest Management Handbook provides current information on selection, application, and safe usage of pest control chemicals.
