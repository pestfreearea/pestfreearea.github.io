<p>A pest specialist can help execute a tailored Integrated Pest Management program for your business. This was supported by an extensive set of documents, covering approved pesticides, the skills of the pest control operator, application sites, and application approaches, among other info as described in Chapter 1. These were kept track of on an everyday, weekly, and month-to-month basis, as pertinent.</p>
<p>The lots of differing hazards from pests make it advisable for cultural heritage organizations to develop an Integrated Preventive Pest Management program for their structures and collections. In these countries, regular use of pesticides is restricted to high value (money) crops and, as such, IPM adoption is mainly centered on cotton, rice, sugarcane, and soybean.</p>
<p>Other pesticides, like surface sprays and termite treatments, linger in the environment for days, weeks or perhaps longer after application. 9 Biological control can be an essential component of an integrated pest management programme.
