<p>Although planting alfalfa strips in strawberry fields to attract and vacuum the western ruined plant bug, Lygus hesperus, has actually been recommended as an IPM technique by Swezey et al. (2007 ), the idea did not take off because growers were not ready for such an intercropping arrangement. If your center currently makes use of an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) program, you won't be amazed to hear that the pest control industry has and will continue to move toward least-impact product or services.</p>
