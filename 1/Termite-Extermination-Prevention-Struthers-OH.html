<p>The many varying dangers from pests make it recommended for cultural heritage companies to establish an Integrated Preventive Pest Management program for their collections and structures. In these countries, routine use of pesticides is limited to high value (cash) crops and, as such, IPM adoption is largely centered on cotton, rice, soybean, and sugarcane.</p>
