<p>Fifty seven of 66 broad spectrum pesticides used on rice at the time were banned by governmental decree (Morse & Buhler 1997). In addition to the research study and outreach structure and the four parts of management, factors that influence lucrative, safe, and affordable food production at a larger scale and their ramifications for international food security should also be included in an IPM model.</p>
<p>Biological control has been effectively utilized in greenhouses (van Lenteren 1988) and specialty crops such as strawberries grown in the field (Zalom et al. 2018 ). To address invasive pest concerns, classical biological control approach is generally used where natural enemies from the native region of the invasive pest are imported, increased, and launched in the new environment of the pest (Kenis et al. 2017, Heimpel and Dick 2018 ). The release of irradiated, sterilized insects is another biological control strategy that has been efficiently utilized versus a number of pests (Klassen and Curtis 2005 ).</p>
