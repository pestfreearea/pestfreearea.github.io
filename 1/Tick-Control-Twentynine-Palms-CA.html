<p>The 4 major issues come across with conventional pesticides are harmful residues, pest resistance, secondary pests, and pest renewal (Lewis, 1997 ). Using natural pesticides and organophosphates that are more environmentally friendly are synthetic and encouraged pesticides should just be used as a last hope or only utilized as required and frequently only at specific times in a pests life cycle.</p>

People try to control the pests themselves by using different chemicals however they don't know the procedure to utilize that chemical which will be hazardous to them.</p>
<p>Likewise, consider how the variety of plants to be grown in the exact same location may influence ease of pesticide applications and spread of disease. Pest control pertains to non-lethal methods too, such as keeping the location totally free and tidy of any food debris or other attractants, sealing up entry methods such as cracks in walls or the area in between the bottom of the floor and a door.</p>
