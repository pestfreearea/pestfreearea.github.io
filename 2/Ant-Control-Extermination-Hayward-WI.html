The chemical controls are applied just after regular monitoring suggests that a pest population had reached a financial threshold level. Numerous specific commodity growers, for such crop as strawberries and potatoes, are working to specify what IPM means for their crop and region, and IPM-labeled foods are available in restricted locations.</p>
<p>In recommendation to the principle of incorporating the use of other and biological controls in complementary methods, the term was later broadened to embrace collaborated usage of all biological, cultural, and synthetic practices (van den Bosch and Stern, 1962). Some natural enemies are inherently more resistant to insecticides than others, and some populations of natural enemies have actually been chosen either naturally or through the efforts of researchers to have greater levels of resistance.</p>
