<p>Integrated Pest Management (IPM) is a community approach to crop production and security that integrates different management methods and practices to grow healthy crops and minimize using pesticides. By completing and utilising an IPM strategy, members may have the ability to conserve cash on pest control approaches which were previously utilized and can possibly decrease future problems with pesticide resistance on farm. The majority of insecticides fall into the chemical category since they are typically more efficient and can typically be utilized to control a number of pests. Physical barriers such as fences, webs, mulch, and tree trunk guards can leave out pests and lower the damage they cause.</p>
<p>Organic food production is not pesticide-free and a few of the pesticides used in a natural system are as damaging to humans and nontarget organisms as some chemical pesticides.
