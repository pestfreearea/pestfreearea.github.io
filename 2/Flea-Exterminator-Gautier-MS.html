<p>For example, according to the United States Department of Agriculture-Agricultural Research Study Service (USDA-ARS 2018 ), IPM is a sustainable, science-based, decision-making procedure that combines biological, cultural, physical, and chemical tools to determine, manage, and reduce threat from pests and pest management tools and methods in such a way that minimizes overall financial, health, and ecological risks.</p>
<p>Four decades later, Breda Pest Management has turned into one of the largest termite and pest control companies in Georgia. To determine IPM adoption, it is needed to determine the elements that determine whether a pest control program certifies as an IPM system. Pest-tolerant crops such as soybeans might not call for interventions unless the pests are numerous or quickly increasing.</p>
