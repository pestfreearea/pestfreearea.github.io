<p>Here are some natural, non-toxic ways to control home insect pests. Lots of anti-pesticide NGOs have a much more simplified definition of IPM - they see IPM as being almost exclusively about minimizing pesticide usage.

<p>It keeps the use of pesticide and other interventions to levels that are economically and ecologically warranted and minimises dangers to human health and the environment. In a metaanalysis of information of 145 studies, the effectiveness of either predators or parasitoids was shown to be great in lowering the number of pests and increasing pest death (Stiling and Cornelissen, 2005).</p>

A study carried out by Parsa et al. (2014) also showed that an absence of qualified IPM specialists and extension educators was an obstacle for IPM execution in industrialized countries.</p>
<p>For example, diesel-powered tractors are run for vacuuming western tainted bug in strawberry 2-3 times or more weekly while a pesticide application normally requires the use of tractor once every 7-14 d.
