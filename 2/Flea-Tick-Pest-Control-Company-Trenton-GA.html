Socio-psychological elements consisting of rational and ethical considerations were discovered to the motorists in IPM application in Iran (Rezaei et al. 2019 ). A study of vegetable growers in Sri Lanka showed that nearly 50% of them practiced calendar-based chemical pesticide applications prior to pest or illness occurrence and just 20% had some understanding of IPM (Jayasooriya and Aheeyar 2016 ). A survey performed by Parsa et al. (2014) also revealed that an absence of certified IPM specialists and extension educators was an obstacle for IPM implementation in industrialized nations.</p>
<p>Some also acknowledged that if regionally collaborated IPM could happen, even yearly management of a consistent pest could be made more efficient (Faust and Chandler, 1998). We recruit exterminators who focus on industrial or business pest control. Continuous training and education of farmers represent the cornerstone for facility of efficient and solid IPM program in agroecosystems.</p>
