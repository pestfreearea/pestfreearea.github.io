A study of vegetable growers in Sri Lanka showed that nearly 50% of them practiced calendar-based chemical pesticide applications prior to pest or illness occurrence and just 20% had some understanding of IPM (Jayasooriya and Aheeyar 2016 ). A survey performed by Parsa et al. (2014) also revealed that an absence of certified IPM specialists and extension educators was an obstacle for IPM implementation in industrialized nations.</p>

We recruit exterminators who focus on industrial or business pest control. Continuous training and education of farmers represent the cornerstone for facility of efficient and solid IPM program in agroecosystems.</p>
