<p>For example, according to the United States Department of Agriculture-Agricultural Research Service (USDA-ARS 2018 ), IPM is a sustainable, science-based, decision-making process that combines biological, cultural, physical, and chemical tools to recognize, manage, and minimize threat from pests and pest management tools and methods in a way that decreases overall financial, health, and environmental threats.</p>
<p>In reference to the principle of incorporating using biological and other controls in complementary methods, the term was later broadened to embrace collaborated use of all biological, cultural, and synthetic practices (van den Bosch and Stern, 1962). Some natural opponents are inherently more resistant to insecticides than others, and some populations of natural opponents have actually been chosen either naturally or through the efforts of researchers to possess greater levels of resistance.</p>
<p>In many cases, they will be. If so, an application of a nonselective insecticide might eliminate them, permitting the pest population to rebound uninhibited by parasites and predators, which may have been providing significant control.
