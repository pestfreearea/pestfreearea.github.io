<p>The first line of defense in IPM is to avoid and reduce insect pest population through nonchemical methods such as cultural practices, use of resistant varieties, appropriate watering and fertilization, and natural opponents. IPM considers the environment as a whole and considers a balanced mix of the abovementioned control techniques to produce the most effective and least destructive plan.</p>
<p>In referral to the principle of integrating using other and biological controls in complementary methods, the term was later on broadened to accept coordinated use of all biological, cultural, and synthetic practices (van den Bosch and Stern, 1962). Some natural opponents are inherently more resistant to insecticides than others, and some populations of natural enemies have been picked either naturally or through the efforts of scientists to have greater levels of resistance.</p>
