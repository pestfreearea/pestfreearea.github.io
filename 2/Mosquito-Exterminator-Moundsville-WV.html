IPM is an approach to guarantee financial viability at both consumer and producer level (seller is constantly expected to make a profit), ecological security through a balanced use of all available pest control alternatives, and social reputation because IPM-based food is safe and affordable.</p>

<p>Under this plan, bug control was "monitored" by certified entomologists and insecticide applications were based upon conclusions reached from regular tracking of pest and natural-enemy populations.

Sprays, are best used versus flying pests and biting pests, such as fleas Many insects will die within minutes of entering into contact with an insecticide spray, but some persistent bugs might make you spray the location multiple times prior to quiting.</p>
<p>When used successfully, nonchemical control alternatives delay, minimize, or eliminate using chemical pesticides. Rentokil uses chemical-free control approaches appropriate for sensitive business environments and Insect Screen Units to detect signs of activity. Stresses pest management, within a well balanced system whereas control method recommends direct intervention with little issue for sustainability (Alastair, 2003 ).</p>
