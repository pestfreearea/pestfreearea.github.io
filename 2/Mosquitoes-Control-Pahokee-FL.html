Therefore, a simple switch to nontoxic pesticides, such as microbials or inundative releases of natural opponents, although useful in reducing environmental contamination and security issues, still does not truly address the environmentally based weakness of the standard pest control technique.</p>

IPM is mainly targeted at establishing systems based upon non-chemical and biological approaches as much as possible.</p>
<p>The numerous differing dangers from pests make it advisable for cultural heritage organizations to establish an Integrated Preventive Pest Management program for their collections and structures.
