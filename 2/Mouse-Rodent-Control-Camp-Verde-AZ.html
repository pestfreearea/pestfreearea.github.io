<p>Dorchester County operates a Mosquito Control Program to protect its citizens from the spread of mosquito-borne illness by spraying pesticides (insecticides), applying larvicide to low-lying locations, and informing its residents on minimizing the conditions that cultivate increases in the mosquito population. This mix of IGRs can be efficient in avoiding re-infestation of pests such as cockroaches. SWPM is susceptible to attack by wood boring insects which, in a collection environment, might trigger severe damage to structures, office furnishings, specimens and artifacts. Applicators perform more intricate tasks, have the ability to utilize a broader range of pesticides, and might concentrate on a specific location of pest control.</p>
<p>Pesticide dangers include severe, immediate toxicity to people and other non-target organisms; chronic or long-lasting toxicity such as cancer; and environmental contamination of the air, or ground and surface area water. We asked four of our branding professionals to come up with ideas for Pest Control business names.
