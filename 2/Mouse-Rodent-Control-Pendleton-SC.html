<p>They believed that some characteristics of area-wide management are incompatible with numerous traditional IRM techniques, but recommended that usage of biologically based control tactics, such as behavior-disrupting chemicals, may add to both area-wide pest management and IRM. After executing any pest management method, check the indication plants to evaluate if arthropod pests have been killed and evaluate the efficiency and longevity of control.</p>
