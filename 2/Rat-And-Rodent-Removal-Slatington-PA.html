<p>For some tasks, pest control employees use a combination of pest management techniques, a practice referred to as incorporated pest management. The cornerstone of a reliable IPM program is a schedule of regular evaluations. Crop losses due to weeds, arthropods, and illness, though challenged by some as a valid step, have actually increased on a world basis from 34.9% in 1965 (3) to 42.1% in 1988-1990 (4) in spite of the augmentation of pest control.</p>
<p>IPM approaches consist of both chemical and nonchemical methods to prevent and control pest populations from reaching financially damaging levels. In IPM, pesticides are used at the tiniest effective dose when other methods of pest control have actually stopped working. IPM is an ecosystem-based strategy that focuses on long-lasting avoidance of pests or their damage through a combination of methods such as biological control, habitat control, modification of cultural practices, and usage of resistant varieties.</p>
<p>The many differing risks from pests make it suggested for cultural heritage organizations to develop an Integrated Preventive Pest Management program for their buildings and collections. In these countries, routine use of pesticides is limited to high value (cash) crops and, as such, IPM adoption is largely centered on cotton, soybean, rice, and sugarcane.</p>
