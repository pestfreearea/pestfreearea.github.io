<p>The professional user must keep the use of pesticides and other forms of intervention to levels that are needed, e.g. by minimized dosages, decreased application frequency or partial applications, considering that the level of danger in plant life is appropriate and they do not increase the danger for development of resistance in populations of harmful organisms.</p>
