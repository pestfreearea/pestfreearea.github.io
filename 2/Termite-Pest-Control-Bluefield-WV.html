<p>With IPM you'll use the most selective pesticide that will get the job done and be the most safe for other organisms and for air, water, and soil quality; usage pesticides in bait stations rather than sprays; or spot-spray a few weeds rather of an entire area. Due to any variety of factors, including those mentioned in the Chemical and Cultural areas, jeopardizing the effectiveness of natural opponents frequently allows possible pest organisms to experience essentially unregulated population growth and enables them to reach pest status.</p>
<p>Beet armyworm larvae intoxicated by sublethal does of MVP (Mycogen, San Diego) (a Bt-derived biopesticide) experience slowed down advancement and feeding and undergo higher parasitism than nontreated beet armyworm larvae (40 ). In other words, a reliable, nondisruptive way to manage a moderate beet armyworm break out may be to retard its development and damage while giving the parasitoids time to work, thereby strengthening the parasitoids' result throughout subsequent generations.</p>
