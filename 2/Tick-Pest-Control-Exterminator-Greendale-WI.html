Although planting alfalfa strips in strawberry fields to draw in and vacuum the western tarnished plant bug, Lygus hesperus, has actually been recommended as an IPM technique by Swezey et al. (2007 ), the idea did not remove since growers were not prepared for such an intercropping arrangement. If your facility currently utilizes an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) program, you will not be amazed to hear that the pest control market has and will continue to move toward least-impact services and products.</p>
