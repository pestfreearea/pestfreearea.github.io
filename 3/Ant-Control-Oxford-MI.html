<p>Socio-psychological elements including ethical and logical factors to consider were found to the drivers in IPM execution in Iran (Rezaei et al. 2019 ). A survey of veggie growers in Sri Lanka revealed that nearly 50% of them practiced calendar-based chemical pesticide applications prior to pest or illness event and only 20% had some understanding of IPM (Jayasooriya and Aheeyar 2016 ). A survey conducted by Parsa et al. (2014) likewise revealed that a lack of qualified IPM experts and extension teachers was an obstacle for IPM implementation in industrialized countries.</p>
<p>The technique to be selected for IPM depends on many factors, the important of which are nature of target pest, the environment, and financial aspect of the management.
