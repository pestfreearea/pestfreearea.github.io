<p>Organic food production is not pesticide-free and some of the pesticides used in an organic system are as hazardous to humans and nontarget organisms as some chemical pesticides. Pest control professionals can just do so much to protect the food supply," states Dr. Zia Siddiqi, Director of Quality Systems at Orkin The truth is, food business operators need to take an active role in integrated pest management by working carefully with the professionals.</p>
<p>Select from among our repeating service programs - monthly, bimonthly, quarterly to prevent unwanted pests from returning. Numerous home and entrepreneur wait until they see mouse droppings, cockroaches debris, and other indications of pests before getting in touch with a pest exterminator. People try to control the pests themselves by using different chemicals but they don't have knowledge of the procedure to utilize that chemical which will be hazardous to them.</p>
