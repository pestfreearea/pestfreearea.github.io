<p>The goal of development must be to protect and where possible boost production of healthy food per hectare, with very little use of synthetic fertilizer and chemical pesticides. Documents would be hard to acquire even if concerted efforts were made due to the several prospective causes for long-term and brief diseases and symptoms associated with direct exposure to pests and pesticides.</p>
<p>Early detection oftentimes can help address the pest circumstance by inexpensive spot treatment or removal of pests or contaminated or infested plant product. Unique strategies such as silencing of pest gene or RNA interference (RNAi) and endosymbionts hosted by insect pests could be used as possible new tools for future management of insect pests.</p>
<p>Here are some natural, non-toxic ways to control home bug pests. Lots of anti-pesticide NGOs have a far more simplified meaning of IPM - they see IPM as being nearly exclusively about minimizing pesticide use. If all other incorporated pest management strategies are unable to keep an insect pest population listed below a financial threshold, then usage of an insecticide to control the pest and avoid economic loss is warranted.</p>
<p>Some of these are: neem spray, prepared from neem kernels (Azadirachta indica) extract, effective against drawing pests, jassids, bollworms and thrips; pyrethrum, prepared from powdered flower heads or liquid extracts of chrysanthemum, reliable against red cotton bug, cutworms, grasshoppers; botanical mixes, mixes of extracts from various plants such as castor, thorn apple, lantana, custard apple, sweet potato leaves, tomato leaves, ginger, cold, gliricidia, marigold, and so on</p>
