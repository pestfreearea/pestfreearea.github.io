The pest management industry is big, with over 15,000 companies serving the general public and approximately 150,000 pest control service workers.

Likewise, pest and crop management disciplines should interact to develop control suggestions that show these interactions.</p>

Chemical controls were to be applied only after routine tracking showed that a pest population had actually reached a level (the financial threshold) that needed treatment to avoid the population from reaching a level (the financial injury level) at which economic losses would exceed the expense of the control procedures.</p>
