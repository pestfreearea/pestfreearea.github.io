<p>These may or might not consist of products noted on the Organic Products Review Institute (OMRI) 15 Although the pesticides and especially insecticides used in natural farming and organic gardening are usually much safer than artificial pesticides, they are not always more ecologically friendly or safe than synthetic pesticides and can cause harm.</p>
<p>Examples of cultural practices that motivate natural enemies and dissuade pest persistence include intercropping (multiple crops in the same field) to make it harder for pests to discover a host plant, planting trap crops which draw in pests away from harvest crops and which can later on be treated with choose application of pesticides, and postponing planting times to coincide with times where pests have emerged and died off for the season.</p>
<p>You just need to spend an hour on the web to be overwhelmed by worldwide problems: the vicious cycle that arises from using large quantities of artificial fertilizer, which increases dependence on pesticides, which in turn causes resistance and damage of the environment and human health - while in fifty years' time the world's stocks of the most crucial part of synthetic fertilizer, phosphate, will almost have run out.</p>
