<p>The numerous varying hazards from pests make it advisable for cultural heritage organizations to develop an Integrated Preventive Pest Management program for their collections and structures. In these countries, regular use of pesticides is restricted to high worth (money) crops and, as such, IPM adoption is mainly centered on cotton, sugarcane, soybean, and rice.</p>

We can deal with a large variety of pests found in Texas, including spiders, ants, termites, fleas, ticks, roaches, bed bugs, rodents and other invaders. Sprays, are best utilized versus flying pests and biting pests, such as fleas Many insects will die within minutes of coming into contact with an insecticide spray, however some persistent bugs may make you spray the location multiple times before giving up.</p>
