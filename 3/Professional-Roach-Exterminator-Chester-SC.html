<p>They thought that some attributes of area-wide management are incompatible with many standard IRM techniques, however suggested that usage of biologically based control strategies, such as behavior-disrupting chemicals, may contribute to both area-wide pest management and IRM. After implementing any pest management strategy, check the sign plants to assess if arthropod pests have actually been killed and evaluate the effectiveness and durability of control.</p>
<p>When pest issues are prevented, pests are not present to do damage, so no control measures are required. Arthropod resistance to abamectin (Stumpf and Nauen 2002 ), B. thuringiensis formulas or its cry toxic substances in genetically modified crops (Hama et al. 1992, Tabashnik et al. 2013 ), spinosad (Scott 2008 ), and other biopesticides (Dara 2017) are well recorded.</p>

Many people normally think of pest control during the warmer months, when swarms of insects try to invade their lawns and houses, however, pests know no season. A green pest management IPM program utilizes pesticides derived from plants, such as botanicals, or other naturally occurring products.</p>

Evaluation is often among the most important steps in Integrated Pest Management (Bennett et al., 2005 ). It is the process of examining an IPM program and the results it has generated.</p>
