<p>The principle has been around considering that the 1920's when cotton pest management program was established. Pest control companies know the right pesticide to utilize in any scenario, this conserves a lot of costs. Poisoning by exposure to pesticides might happen quickly after a single exposure (acute poisoning) or gradually after repeated exposures over an amount of time (chronic poisoning).</p>
<p>In contrast, organic food production uses many of the exact same principles as IPM however restricts the use of pesticides to those that are produced from natural sources, as opposed to synthetic chemicals. Other claims consist of reductions in pesticide use from incorporation of genes for Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) into several crops to control insect pests and incorporation of resistance to some herbicides into numerous crops to lower the requirement for other, less environmentally favorable, herbicides.</p>
