Pest control is required because insects and rodents bring diseases, infest your kitchens and bed rooms, and bite you or your family pets. Usage indication plants to identify the efficacy of pest management methods and to monitor prone crops for the infections (tospoviruses) such as impatiens lethal area virus (INSV) and tomato found wilt virus (TSWV).</p>
