<p>Organic food production is not pesticide-free and a few of the pesticides used in an organic system are as harmful to humans and nontarget organisms as some chemical pesticides. Pest control specialists can just do so much to safeguard the food supply," states Dr. Zia Siddiqi, Director of Quality Systems at Orkin The truth is, food business operators need to take an active role in integrated pest management by working closely with the professionals.</p>
<p>For instance, diesel-powered tractors are operated for vacuuming western tarnished bug in strawberry 2-3 times or more every week while a pesticide application generally requires the use of tractor when every 7-14 d. To control particular pests, multiple applications of organic pesticides might be required with associated risks and costs, while similar pest populations might be managed by less chemical pesticide applications.</p>
