Pest control workers must remain in good health, because of the physical needs of the job, and they also should be able to withstand unpleasant conditions-- such as the heat of climbing into an attic in the summer or the chill of moving into a crawlspace throughout winter season. Tolerance of pests differs according to the health risk (low tolerance) or simply a cosmetic damage (high tolerance in a non-commercial situation).</p>
<p>They thought that some qualities of areawide management are incompatible with many standard IRM strategies, however recommended that the use of biologically based control tactics, such as behavior-disrupting chemicals, may contribute to both areawide pest management and IRM.
