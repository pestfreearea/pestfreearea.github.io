<p>The four significant issues encountered with standard pesticides are poisonous residues, pest resistance, secondary pests, and pest renewal (Lewis, 1997 ). The use of natural pesticides and organophosphates that are more environmentally friendly are encouraged and synthetic pesticides need to only be used as a last resort or just utilized as needed and frequently just at particular times in a pests life process.</p>
<p>Employing pest control services mean that safety precedes. Applying pest management and monitoring strategies will also ensure the decrease of crop loss or damage by pests. Typically infestations of these two kinds of insects do not need repetitive pesticide applications. Pest control operators, farmers, premises and structures supervisors, wildlife management experts, crop specialists and others can have their services or products certified under a variety of programs that utilize IPM as a requirement.</p>
<p>Biological control techniques can also be seen as natural solutions as they do not depend on using pesticides or other chemicals. Pest control is essential since rodents and insects carry diseases, infest your kitchens and bedrooms, and bite you or your family pets. Use indication plants to figure out the effectiveness of pest management tactics and to keep an eye on susceptible crops for the infections (tospoviruses) such as impatiens lethal spot infection (INSV) and tomato found wilt virus (TSWV).</p>
<p>Link to PRI's Pest Management Publications to learn about low-impact methods of pest control that reduce pesticide usage and direct exposure.
